How to Save a Life is an interactive simulation of a life-saving process involving chest compressions, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and emergency calls. The star of the installation is the CPR doll Tage, who was created using a wide range of sensors and actuators as well as everyday materials found at home (such as an easter egg for the head!).

The system gives the user feedback on for example rate and amount of compressions while also registering details such as whether the chin was lifted while performing rescue breaths. In the case of a misstep in the life-saving process, the user is informed on what went wrong through a visual display. If, however, the life saving performance is satisfactory, Tage starts breathing as a result. The breathing is simulated using a servo motor to lift the chest up and down.

The work presented in this repository is one half of a larger project, where the other half is an ambulance simulation game created by two classmates. The merging of the two projects resulted in a two player game with two ways of finalizing the interaction; steering the ambulance fast enough to the location of the emergency or performing CPR effective enough to wake the person in need.
